# Hello, World! - A First Program

Traditionally, when learning a programming language, the first program you write should output or print `Hello, world` to the screen.

This C program shows the basic structure of a simple C program:
- Include statements to include header files (as if their contents were prepended to the file).
- A main function that contains statements and expressions to perform.

This program needs to be compiled before it can be run. To compile it on a unix system, run the following:

```SHELL
cc hello-world.c
```

If you are on another kind of system, then check the documentation for your compiler.

Once it is compiled, you can run the output program like so:

```SHELL
./a.out
```
