# Symbolic Constants

As in other languages, C makes use of symbolic constants to replace values that do not change in the course of the code's execution and that would otherwise appear unintelligible (or perhaps only difficultly so) to someone reading the program later. 

In C, the convention is to use uppercase names for constants. They do not need type declarations, but they are preceded by `#define`.

```C
#define LOWER 0
```
