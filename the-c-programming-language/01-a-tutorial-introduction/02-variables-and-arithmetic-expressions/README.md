# Variables and Arithmetic Expressions

The second program uses a Fahrenheit-Celsius temperature converter to show how to work with basic types, along with the `while` control structure for iterating over collections of items.

## Basic Types

- char: character - a single byte
- short: short integer
- long: long integer
- double: double-precision floating point

## Prompts
- Exercise 1-3. Modify the termperature conversion program to print a heading above the table.
- Exercise 1-4. Write a program to print the corresponding Celsius to Fahrenheit table.
